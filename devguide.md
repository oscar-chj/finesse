## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js or Vue.js
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (primary), MongoDB (secondary)
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow or PyTorch (for financial insights)
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0, Firebase/Auth0 (for user authentication)
- **Push Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging
- **Hosting/Cloud**: AWS, GCP, or Azure
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub/GitLab
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI
- **Security**: JWT, OAuth 2.0, TLS/SSL, AES encryption

## Setup and Installation

### Frontend

1. **Install Dependencies**:
    - React.js (or Vue.js)
    ```bash
    npx create-react-app financial-wellness-dashboard
    cd financial-wellness-dashboard
    npm install
    ```

2. **Install UI Libraries**:
    - Material-UI or Ant Design
    ```bash
    npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    npm install antd
    ```

3. **State Management**:
    - Redux (React)
    ```bash
    npm install redux react-redux
    ```

4. **Charts & Visualization**:
    - Chart.js or D3.js
    ```bash
    npm install chart.js
    ```

### Backend

1. **Set Up Node.js & Express**:
    - Initialize the project
    ```bash
    mkdir backend
    cd backend
    npm init -y
    npm install express dotenv cors axios
    ```

2. **Set Up Database**:
    - Install PostgreSQL (for relational data)
    ```bash
    npm install pg pg-hstore sequelize
    ```
    - Install MongoDB (for user preferences, session data)
    ```bash
    npm install mongoose
    ```

3. **Install Authentication & Security**:
    - OAuth 2.0 for API access
    ```bash
    npm install oauth2-server
    ```
    - JWT for user authentication
    ```bash
    npm install jsonwebtoken
    ```

4. **API Integration**:
    - Use Axios to connect to Open Finance APIs (Plaid, Yodlee, local Malaysian APIs)
    ```bash
    npm install axios
    ```

### AI/ML

1. **Install TensorFlow.js** for browser-based AI/ML
    ```bash
    npm install @tensorflow/tfjs
    ```

### DevOps

1. **Containerization with Docker**:
    - Install Docker and set up a `Dockerfile` for both frontend and backend.

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
    - Set up GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for continuous integration and deployment.

## Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

- **Component-Based Design**: Build reusable UI components like cards, modals, and charts.
- **State Management**: Use Redux or Vuex to manage global state, such as user information and financial data.
- **Data Flow**: Components should be loosely coupled and communicate via state or props.

### Backend Architecture

- **RESTful API**: The backend should expose endpoints to handle:
    - User registration and authentication
    - Financial data fetching and aggregation
    - Budget planning, expense tracking, and financial insights
- **Data Aggregation**: Implement data aggregation services to pull financial data from Open Finance APIs.
- **Database Models**: Define models for storing user profiles, financial data, transaction history, etc.

### Security

- **Authentication**: Use OAuth 2.0 for secure API access and JWT for user authentication.
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., transactions, personal information) using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and ensure secure communication via TLS/SSL.

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- **Main Branch**: The production-ready code should reside in the `main` branch.
- **Development Branch**: All new features should be developed in the `dev` branch and merged into `main` after thorough testing.
- **Feature Branches**: For each feature or bug fix, create a new branch (e.g., `feature/login`, `bugfix/expense-chart`).

### Code Reviews

- Submit pull requests (PRs) for every change, and ensure thorough code reviews before merging.
- Follow the [Google JavaScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.html) or [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

### Testing

1. **Unit Tests**:
    - Use Jest or Mocha for testing individual functions and components.
    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev jest
    ```

2. **Integration Tests**:
    - Test the integration of backend APIs with the frontend and third-party services (Open Finance APIs).

3. **Security Testing**:
    - Conduct regular penetration tests using tools like OWASP ZAP.

4. **End-to-End Testing**:
    - Use Cypress or Selenium for end-to-end testing.

---

## Deployment

1. **Cloud Hosting**: Deploy the app using cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure. Use services like Elastic Beanstalk (AWS) or App Engine (GCP) for the backend, and Firebase or S3 for the frontend.

2. **Beta Testing**: Deploy a beta version to a limited group of users to collect feedback.
    - Use Firebase Hosting or Netlify for quick deployment of the frontend.

3. **Full Launch**: Once the app has been tested and refined, deploy it to the public with a marketing campaign.

---

## Best Practices

- **Modular Design**: Keep the frontend and backend modular and reusable.
- **Error Handling**: Implement global error handling for both frontend and backend to ensure smooth user experience.
- **Performance**: Optimize API calls, database queries, and ensure efficient data flow.

---

## Future Considerations

- **Global API Integrations**: Expand integrations to support international financial services.
- **Gamification**: Add gamified elements to improve user engagement with financial literacy modules.
- **Advanced AI Features**: Implement more advanced machine learning models to provide personalized financial advice.
